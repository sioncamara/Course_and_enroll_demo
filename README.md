Please refer to the [Canvas Assignment](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/273395/assignments/1370284) and [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C9o4PGHY6sKbFj44EbERLO2y33tCYS2U_-051uqMiI8/edit?usp=sharing) for instructions on completing this assignment. You should copy your code from your React 1 Î± project to this repository, as that will be your starter code. When you commit and push, ensure that you are commiting and pushing to this react1-beta repository, not react1-alpha. 

Your deliverable will be the following: 
1. Completed Google Doc, attached to the canvas assignment as a PDF
2. GitHub Classroom repository name and latest commit hash, entered to the canvas assignment as a comment (e.g. `react1-beta-osori, 7a0bc38`)
